In this repository, I am sharing notebooks and scripts of weekly ML/DL challenges. 
The challenges comprises of twelve week simple to complex projects and are listed below 

Week 1: Churn or Drop-off Prediction (Imbalanced Data)
• Build a binary classification model for churn/user drop-off.
• Focus: preprocessing, imbalance handling, pipelines, ROC/AUC evaluation.
• Tools: scikit-learn, SMOTE/class weights.
• Deliverable: Jupyter notebook + interpretation.

Week 2: Time-Series Forecasting
• Predict future values using past window features.
• Focus: rolling windows, cross-validation for time series, feature engineering.
• Deliverable: Notebook with exploratory plots, baseline + improved model comparison.

Week 3: Text Classification (Sentiment/Topic)
• Perform sentiment or topic classification on text data.
• Focus: TF-IDF, n-gram features, multiple model comparisons.
• Deliverable: Notebook + write-up on model comparison and feature insights.

Week 4: Mixed Data (Tabular + Text)
• Combine text and numeric features for prediction.
• Focus: multi-modal pipelines, categorical handling, evaluation.
• Deliverable: Notebook comparing tabular-only vs combined models.

Week 5: Scalable Data Processing
• Work with large data using Dask or PySpark.
• Focus: efficient preprocessing, reproducibility, model persistence.
• Deliverable: Script or notebook with scaling demonstration and saved model.
