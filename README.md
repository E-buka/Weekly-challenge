### Challenges repository
In this repository, I am sharing notebooks of ML/DL challenges. 
The challenges comprises of twelve simple to complex projects and are listed below.
No 5 and 6 are refactored as a github project and found in the tweet-project repository.


No 1: Churn or Drop-off Prediction (Imbalanced Data)
• Build a binary classification model for churn/user drop-off.
• Focus: preprocessing, imbalance handling, pipelines, ROC/AUC evaluation.
• Tools: scikit-learn, SMOTE/class weights.
• Deliverable: Jupyter notebook + interpretation.

No 2: Time-Series Forecasting
• Predict future values using past window features.
• Focus: rolling windows, cross-validation for time series, feature engineering.
• Deliverable: Notebook with exploratory plots, baseline + improved model comparison.

No 3: Text Classification (Sentiment/Topic)
• Perform sentiment or topic classification on text data.
• Focus: TF-IDF, n-gram features, multiple model comparisons.
• Deliverable: Notebook + write-up on model comparison and feature insights.

No 4: Mixed Data (Tabular + Text)
• Combine text and numeric features for prediction.
• Focus: multi-modal pipelines, categorical handling, evaluation.
• Deliverable: Notebook comparing tabular-only vs combined models.

No 5: Scalable Data Processing
• Work with large data using Dask or PySpark.
• Focus: efficient preprocessing, reproducibility, model persistence.
• Deliverable: Script or notebook with scaling demonstration and saved model.

No 5: Scalable Data Processing
• Work with large data using Dask or PySpark.
• Focus: efficient preprocessing, reproducibility, model persistence.
• Deliverable: Script or notebook with scaling demonstration and saved model.

No 6: Model Deployment (API or Dashboard)
• Deploy an existing scikit-learn model as an API or web app.
• Focus: model persistence (joblib), FastAPI or Streamlit,
Deliverable: Deployed demo + GitHub README.

No 7: Neural Network from Scratch (Transition to DL)
• Implement an MLP for tabular data using PyTorch or Keras.
• Focus: NN foundations, hyperparameter tuning, regularization.
• Deliverable: Notebook comparing NN vs classical model + insights.

No 8: Image Classification (Transfer Learning)
• Use a pretrained CNN for image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10).
• Focus: transfer learning, data preprocessing, fine-tuning, evaluation.
• Deliverable: Notebook with results and discussion of transfer learning benefits
